Work in progress. Using my own course as a test.

Directory structure:

content - For the content of the course... homework, labs, etc
static - Content that will be copied verbatim to the output
output - All content that is generated or in static will be placed here
src - The source code for the generator logic and controller
config - Course information gets placed here (model data)
html - Haml code (view)
css - Sass code (view)

Might merge content and config. However, config is model data and content is
just extra pages (in markdown, etc)

Controller and model are in one place... kinda iffy design.

The views will be themable. So, a course can be passed to a new view without
any changes to the rest of the code or course data. This means a consistent
controller, which should be fine.

Now, somebody can take a course they want to present and pick a theme and
just compile the site and throw it up on a webpage.

The eventual idea is to have a collection of repositories to hold courses!

TODO:

markdown README
intructions
gem creation?
figure out how to separate views (for theming)
figure out how to separate course information from this code (gemify)
