Architecture
------------

Model: The classes related to organizing the data that will be materialized via actions of the controller and logic of the view. The data will be fed in from a set of YAML files that describe the course. The model contains functionality to generate more information from the sparse information given in the course schemas.

  * information.yaml : The course instance information. Dates and times and teachers. These pieces of information are generally specific to a particular invocation of a course and are distinct from the material that defines the lectures.

  * Information : The class that represents this yaml file

  * schedule.yaml : This describes the tasks that define the course. Each lecture can be considered a separate day. The dates are filled in with information given by the information schema.

  * Schedule : The class that represents this yaml file

  * assignments.yaml : This describes the workload of the course. Each value defines a set of work. That is, you can say 'labs' is a set of work, and this would suggest that there will be a lab section on the site.

Controller: The classes related to performing actions and feed data to a particular view.

  The Controller will be specialized and lightweight. It is a single class with functions that are defined when necessary for each View. For instance, if there is a schedule.haml View, then it will attempt to call the schedule function in the controller and pass the instance of the controller as the class instance that the view is rendered within.

View: The logic that defines the layout and display of the information. These are given by a combination of Haml, Sass, and Markdown. The views are maintained separately, much like the Yaml course descriptions, such that one particular course may choose from several different views (can be thought of as themes or styles). There is a convention to the filenames in that they designate which functions to call within the Controller.

  * schedule.haml : This file describes how to build a schedule.html that will list the lecture materials for the course.
  * information.haml : This file describes the class instance (teacher, assistants, office hours, etc) for the course as information.html.
  * assignments.haml : This file describes a set of assignments or labs that will be a part of the workload of the course. This is described in assignments.yaml, and may result in hw.html or labs.html, etc based upon the outline of that yaml file. That is, there will be a .html result for each set described in the assignments.yaml file.
